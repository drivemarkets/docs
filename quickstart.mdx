## Overview

drive.markets provides distributed order routing for Polymarket's CLOB API, delivering low-latency execution through globally distributed routing paths.

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using Polymarket's standard headers:

- `POLY-API-KEY`: Your API key
- `POLY-SIGNATURE`: Request signature (signed with your private key)
- `POLY-TIMESTAMP`: Unix timestamp of the request
- `POLY-NONCE`: Unique nonce for the request

These headers are automatically handled when using the Polymarket SDK.

## Using with Polymarket SDK

The API is compatible with Polymarket's SDK. Simply specify ``https://poly.drive.markets`` in the host parameter:

```typescript
import { ClobClient } from '@polymarket/clob-client';

const host = 'https://clob.polymarket.com'
const orderHost = 'https://poly.drive.markets'

const signer = new Wallet("");
const funder = '';

// 1: Magic/Email Login
// 2: Browser Wallet (Metamask, Coinbase Wallet, etc)
// 0: EOA
const signatureType = 1;

const credsClient = new ClobClient(host, 137, signer).createOrDeriveApiKey();

(async () => {
	const creds = await credsClient.createOrDeriveApiKey();

    const clobClient = new ClobClient(host, 137, signer, await creds, signatureType, funder);
	const orderClient = new ClobClient(orderHost, 137, signer);

    const order = await clobClient.createOrder({
    	tokenID: '0x...',
        price: '0.5',
        side: 'BUY',
        size: '100',
        feeRateBps: 100
    });

	const response = await orderClient.postOrder(order, OrderType.FOK);

	return response
})();
```

## Direct API Usage

If you're not using the SDK, you'll need to sign the authentication headers manually:

```bash
curl -X POST https://poly.drive.markets/order \
  -H "POLY-API-KEY: your-api-key" \
  -H "POLY-SIGNATURE: your-signature" \
  -H "POLY-TIMESTAMP: 1234567890" \
  -H "POLY-NONCE: unique-nonce" \
  -d '{
    "order": {
      "salt": 123456789,
      "maker": "0x...",
      "signer": "0x...",
      "taker": "0x...",
      "tokenId": "0x...",
      "makerAmount": "1000000000000000000",
      "takerAmount": "500000000000000000",
      "expiration": "1234567890",
      "nonce": "0",
      "feeRateBps": 100,
      "side": "BUY",
      "signatureType": 0,
      "signature": "0x..."
    },
    "owner": "your-api-key",
    "orderType": "FOK"
  }'
```

## Supported Endpoints
