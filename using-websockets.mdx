While our websocket endpoint is compatible with Polymarket's API, you will have to send JSON messages to the WebSocket to perform order operations.

Currently, the following routes are supported: 
- `/order`
- `/orders`
- `/cancel-all`
- `/cancel-market-orders`

The message structure wraps a standard HTTP request, allowing you to specify the `path`, `method`, `headers`, and `body` that will be forwarded to Polymarket.

## Example Message Structure:

```JSON
{
  "path": "/order",
  "method": "POST",
  "headers": {
    "POLY_ADDRESS": "",
    "POLY_SIGNATURE": "",
    "POLY_TIMESTAMP": "",
    "POLY_API_KEY": "",
    "POLY_PASSPHRASE": ""
  },
  "body": {
    "order": {
      "salt": 123456789,
      "maker": "0x..",
      "signer": "0x..",
      "taker": "0x..",
      "tokenId": "580..",
      "makerAmount": "1000000",
      "takerAmount": "1000000",
      "expiration": "0",
      "nonce": "0",
      "feeRateBps": "0",
      "side": "BUY",
      "signatureType": 1,
      "signature": "0x.."
    },
    "owner": "05..",
    "orderType": "FOK"
  }
}
```

Although this documentation separates operations into different channels for clarity (matching Polymarket's REST endpoints), all messages are sent over the same WebSocket connection. 

You must ensure the `path` property in your JSON payload matches the intended operation.
